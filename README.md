# XJS Playground

I'm currently doing some experimental work for XJS Framework 3.0, and this is where I put my test
apps to test it out manually.

I do have plans to add in some sort of unit testing, although I'm still debating myself if adding
unit tests are actually worth it, or should I just search for ways to do automated end-to-end
testing in XSplit Broadcaster.
