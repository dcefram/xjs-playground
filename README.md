## XJS Test App

I'm currently doing some experimental work for XJS Framework 3.0, and this is what I use to actually
test it out manually.

Pre-req: npm link the local xjs directory.

```
# first, install all of the dependencies (ie. svelte and xjs)
npm i

# now we can run the test app!
npm run dev
```
